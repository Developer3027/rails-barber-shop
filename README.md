# Barber Shop
I had a earlier version of this site built with Elementor. I have since lost that information and access and decided to build a new version in Rails. This is a landing page concept built off the design from [Usman A on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/24202577-Barbershop-Landing-Page) This has a nice clean look and feel with some functionality. I was looking specifically for a similar design but more of a landing page that I could quickly put together on the cheap.

I will need to make some adjustments to the design and include a mobile version as well as pwa. I will put the site up on render and so I will not have email functionality. I will keep the appointment but unclear on if it will be functional atm. Both news and shop would take the visitor away from the page so will be removed.
